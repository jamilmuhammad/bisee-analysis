## 💰 Cost Optimization Features

### Model Selection Strategy
```python
# Router: Fast decisions with lightweight model
"router": ModelConfig(
    model_name="llama3-8b-8192",
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=512,
    cost_per_token=0.00005
)

# SQL Generation: Precision with powerful model
"sql_generator": ModelConfig(
    model_name="llama3-70b-8192",
    temperature=0.0,
    max_tokens=1024,
    cost_per_token=0.0002
)
```

### Usage Tracking

- Cost analysis per session
- Optimization recommendations
- Performance metrics

## 🎯 Few-Shot Prompting Examples

### SQL Generation Example
```python
{
    "kpi": "GROSS_TRANSACTION_VALUE",
    "schema_context": "transactions table with columns: id, amount, status, created_at",
    "sql": """
    -- Calculate Gross Transaction Value (GTV)
    SELECT 
        SUM(amount) as gross_transaction_value,
        COUNT(*) as total_transactions
    FROM transactions 
    WHERE status = 'completed' 
        AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
    """,
    "explanation": "Sums all successful transaction amounts for the last 30 days to calculate GTV"
}
```

    "descriptive": "Fraud rate has increased to 2.5%, which is above industry average of 1.8%",
    "predictive": "If current trend continues, fraud rate may reach 3.2% next quarter",
    "prescriptive": [
        "Implement additional ML-based fraud detection rules",
        "Review and update risk scoring algorithms",
        "Increase monitoring for high-risk transaction patterns"
    ],
    "priority": "high",
